Hello! I'm a rising sophomore majoring in CS. I have been an AI two times before and this is my first time being a reader for CS 10. Before coming into Berkeley, I had never coded before, but taking CS 10 opened my eyes to the wonderful world of Computer Science and really helped me for my future classes. I hope all of you can enjoy CS 10 as much as I did!
