Hello! My name is Ben and I’m a Senior majoring in Cognitive Science with a minor in CS! I took CS10 my first semester at Cal (it was actually the class I was most looking forward to) and was blown away with how amazing computer science is. Besides school, I love the outdoors, exercising, learning about the brain, cybersecurity and all things cinema! I can’t wait to show you the joys of computing!
