Hi there, I'm Drew! I use he or they pronouns. I'm a senior linguistics major, also studying CS (currently taking cs61a). I recently took CS10 and quite enjoyed the class structure and how the material is made accessible to anyone. After seeing how the AIs got to work with students directly in lab and help them work through solving problems and developing the muscle of computational thinking, I wanted to get involved. My primary interest is linguistics, but I am very interested in natural language processing and other computer science/linguistics intersections.
