Hello there! My name is Manaar (she/her/hers), and I'm a junior studying Data Science. This is my fourth semester as an AI for CS10, and it is still one of my favorite classes that I've taken at Cal! Besides taking my major classes and AIing for CS10, this semester I'll also be studying Chinese, teaching machine learning concepts as part of WiCDS, and trying to accomplish my reading goal of 18 books by the end of 2022!
