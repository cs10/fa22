Hello! My name is Jalen and I am Third Year double majoring in Cognitive Science and Psychology with minors in Data Science and Journalism! I took CS10 the Spring of my Freshman year, loved it, and have been a part of the course ever since! Outside of academics I look cooking, making oddly specific music playlists, and keeping my 3 month old kitten from tearing up my apartment. I am excited to meet and work with you all this semester!
