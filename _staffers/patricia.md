Hi everyone!! My name is Patricia and I'm a sophomore studying cs :3 This will be my second semester AI-ing and my first semester as part of LabDev AI+. I took CS10 in my second semester of freshman year and liked the class very much! I'm really exicted to help people out during lab and involve myself in developing the course website ^^ In my free time I enjoy sleeping and scrolling through pinterest for fashion inspiration. Feel free to talk to me about style, kdramas, and sloths :)
