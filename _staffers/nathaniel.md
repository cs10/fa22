Hello there. I am an incoming sophomore studying CS, and this is my
first time teaching CS-10. I have been teaching Python, Java, and
Scratch for the last four years and am excited to teach at Berkeley! My
secret goal this semester is to teach not only the joy of computing but
also the next step toward Computer Science. As a freshman, I had no clue
what to do, and I'm thrilled to show you all the next steps.
