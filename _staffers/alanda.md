Hey yooo I'm a 3rd year studying CS! When I am not dying from assignments, I am probably drawing or playing video games. I was one of the many people obliterated by the dreaded CS61A midterm. Then, like an angel descended from the sky to guide those in need, there was CS10 taught by the legendary Dan Garcia. This course helped me so much in teaching me how to code and it prepared me for my second rodeo with CS61A! So, I wanted to return the favor and contribute to the course :D
