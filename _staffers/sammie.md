Hi! I'm a sophomore studying computer science and this is my second time being an Academic Intern for CS-10. I took CS-10 last fall and I loved the course and learned so much! It was a great entry into the world of computer science and made me much more confident going into later Berkeley CS courses. In my free time I love to watch movies, read, get outdoors, and try new food spots! I look forward to being an AI again this semester!
