Hey !! My name is Calvin and I'm a sophomore studying CS. I took CS10 my freshmen year and it was definitely one of my favorite classes. I didn't have much programming experience so CS10 really paved the way for my CS journey. Looking forward to working with everyone this semester and feel free to message me via email !
