Hello everyone! My name is Sarah, and I am a rising third year double majoring in Cognitive Science and Data Science. I took the CS10 in my first semester and since then have helped with running labs and discussion sections and am excited to finally be on course staff as a reader and AI Head! Outside my studies, I enjoy listening to music, exploring campus at night, and getting involved on campus.
