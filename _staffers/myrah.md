Hello! I'm Myrah, a second year intended computer science major and this is my second time being an AI for CS10. When I started at Berkeley, I had almost no programming experience at all. CS10 helped me become confident in my ability to puruse CS which is why I want to give back to the CS10 community! Outside of CS, I'm into record-collecting and writing.
