I am a senior studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I started programming in high school but didnâ€™t really enjoy it until CS10 at CAL after which I took the 61 Series, CS 70, and EECS 16B. I am most fluent in Java and Python but also know the very basics of HTML, CSS, JS and C (which are for mostly resume purposes). I love playing soccer and am a huge Messi fan. Apart from that, I also love reading fiction (favorite is Harry Potter) and watching anime so if you have any anime stuff you want to talk about I am always here for it. This semester I would be working as a TA for CS10, taking MATH 116, COMPSCI 170, COMPSCI 161, and EECS 106A.
