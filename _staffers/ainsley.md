Hi, I'm a sophomore majoring in History and Cognitive Science and this is my first semester as an AI! I love graphic design, Stardew Valley, and watching Ghibli movies. :) Before CS10 I had absolutely zero programming experience, and taking this course not only helped make coding feel much less scary and intimidating, but also made me realize the many important and exciting ways in which CS is powerfully shaping our world. CS10 is a really special class, and I'm so excited to help out in lab this semester and get to know all of you!
