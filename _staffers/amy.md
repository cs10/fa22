Hi, I'm Amy (she/her)! I'm a third year from SoCal majoring in Data Science. I had little to no CS experience prior to CS10. This class became one of my favorite classes that I've taken here at Berkeley and I've been an AI ever since. On my free time I love watching horror movies/tv shows, listening to music (specifically Bad Bunny or Taylor Swift), or just watching TikToks. I hope to help the best I can this semester!
