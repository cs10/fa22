hi ya'll! i'm a current sophomore studying computer science and cognitive science. CS 10 was my first computer science course here at Berkeley and it was one of my most favorite classes i've taken to date! my interests include AI/ML, data analytics, and software development :) feel free to chat with me about class material or even about cool things to do around SF/Berkeley!  :3
