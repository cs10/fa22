Hi, I’m Deeksha!! I took CS10 my very first semester of college without any coding experience and this past spring I just graduated from Berkeley with my degree in computer science! I’m originally from a small town in Iowa so I’ve really enjoyed exploring SF and the Bay Area over the last 4 years.  In my free time I enjoy dancing, rewatching Friends for the 10th time, listening to music (especially Taylor Swift), and trying out new food places around Berkeley. Teaching is a huge passion of mine which is why I’ve loved being a part of CS10 course staff the past few years and am really looking forward to instructing this summer. CS at Berkeley can often be a really intimidating experience but I really hope that we can help it feel more approachable and welcoming. I’m so excited to meet you all this summer and help you have an amazing experience in this course!
