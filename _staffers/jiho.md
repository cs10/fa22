Hi everyone, my name is JiHo and I'm a junior studying Data Science and CS. Outside of academics, I enjoy sports, specifically basketball and volleyball. I took CS10 last year and this is my first time teaching the class. CS10 was my first ever coding experience so it helped me get into tech but also prepare me for future classes. I hope it can help you as much as it helped me!
