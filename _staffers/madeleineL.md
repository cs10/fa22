Hi! I’m Maddie. I just graduated with my degree in Computer Science here at Cal. I took CS10 my freshman year and fell even deeper in love with CS. I’m a Bay Area native and come home (an hour from Berkeley) frequently to hang out with family. When I’m not coding, you can find me thrifting, learning C++ for my new job, forcing my boyfriend who has perfect pitch to transcribe that one melody from that one song, or attempting to playing Switch with my 10 year old sister. I’m so pumped to be instructing this Summer and am looking forward to getting to know you all!
