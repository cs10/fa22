Hellooooo everyone!! I’m Imen, and I’m officially going to be starting my second year at Cal this Fall as an EECS major after having taken some time off. I took CS 10 in Fall 2020 and knew the moment the course was over that I wanted to come back, and now I’m a Head Discussion TA for this summer! I’ve always enjoyed the growth that comes from me teaching my friends, and I’m looking forward to becoming a better instructor and giving back to the course community that made me feel confident in becoming a programmer! Things I love doing in my spare time are playing volleyball, hiking, exploring and analyzing fashion trends and design practices, binge watching SNL compilations, and reading/watching romance novels and films. I have a lot of laughter (I find a lot of things funny) and curiosity in my system, so philosophical chats and random jokes are always going to pop up. I’m stoked to have you all get to know me a little more this summer and the rest of the course staff. We’re going to have such a blast! (‘:
