Hey everyone! 
My name is Pavit and I’m a sophomore studying CS and Econ. In my free time, I like to play the guitar, watch cricket and soccer games, and watch Community on Netflix. I think CS 10 is a super cool intro to CS and I’m really excited to be helping you guys out as an AI this semester. Feel free to shoot me an email - I’m always down to grab coffee!
