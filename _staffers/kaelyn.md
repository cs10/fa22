Hey everyone! I am a sophomore, and this is my first time being an AI for CS-10. This past summer I took my first CS course, and I instantly fell in love with the beauty of programming. I hope to assist students in their programming endeavors and inspire them to achieve extraodrinary things in the wonderful world of CS!
