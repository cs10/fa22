Hiiii! I'm Eric and I'm a rising sophomore in undeclared engineering intending EECS with possibly a minor in ethnic studies. I took CS10 my first semester at Cal and have been an AI in my second! And now, I'm very excited to be a reader this summer! Aside from CS, I enjoy reading, writing stories, finding new music, walking, and playing games. Hope you guys have a great time this summer
