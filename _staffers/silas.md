Hi! My name is Silas Gifford. I’m a 5th Year MIDS (Master of Information and Data Science) student. I completed my undergraduate honors thesis on counting seals from space using deep learning. I’m originally from Southern California and my favorite museum there is the Norton Simon. I have a cat, Cloe, who loves to hunt bugs and nap in the sun. I look forward to meeting everyone and having good discussions in class and during OH.
