Hi everyone! Iâ€™m a senior at UC Berkeley this year studying Cognitive Science, Data Science, Computer Science and am doing the Certificate in Entrepreneurship and technology and this is my second semester working on staff for CS10. I took CS10 during my first semester Cal and found computer science to be an incredibly fascinating field. In my free time, you can either find me swimming, watching Avatar the Last Airbender, or spending time with friends and family. Excited to work with everyone this semester and show you all the crazy fun world of computing.
