# **Welcome to CS-10 :)**

- Some parts of the website (specifically: the staff page and the extensions form section on the syllabus) are still <b>under construction</b> and will be updated soon.
- Please read Weekly-Blast 1, which has been posted on Ed (#4). If you don't have access to Ed, email cs10@berkeley.edu ASAP. 
- Note that there is no required checkoff for lab-1. However, please do attend Lab section this week.
- Lecture slides, recordings, and live streams + Discussion recordings can be found in the "CS10 Calendar" below. 
- Times and locations for daily CS-10 occurences can be found in the "Daily Schedule"
- The course syllabus linked on this website and the weekly blasts are <b>required readings.</b> We will expect that everyone has read them.
- We strongly encourage students to wear a mask in all CS-10 in-person activities: lecture, lab, discussion, OH, etc. Let's try to be considerate to everyone- there may be immuno-compromised classmates who need us to be as safe as we can!
